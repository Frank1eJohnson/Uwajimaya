# Config file

**Guides:**
- steam_appid.txt - https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Online/Steam/index.html#steamappid


To configure the steam settings you need to change the config file located at [`Config/DefaultEngine.ini`](/Config/DefaultEngine.ini).

> **Note:**
That the `SteamDevAppId` is automatically set at Build time, the value is retrieved from [`Source/UwajimayaBuild.json`](/Source/UwajimayaBuild.json)


For more details see the Guides above.

NOTE: For non shipping builds you must edit `UE4_PROJECT_STEAMSHIPPINGID`
macro, see https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Online/Steam/index.html#steamappid
