 *					   if it isn't claimed anymore it is unloaded after a few sec (HideTime)
 *
 *		Dependent Level: Claimed levels can have dependent level
 *						 A dependent level is loaded when any claimed level references it
 *						 Can be used for areas between two levels - when certain objects are visible from
 *						 two claimed levels a part of them can be moved to a dependent level which is always loaded
 *						 if any of the two claimed level is loaded
