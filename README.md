## Source code

- NOTE: the MIT License only applies to the code in this repository and does not include the actual commercial Uwajimaya game or assets.
- This repository **only contains the code** but **NO Assets** and some missing plugins.
  - So you can't build easily from this source code.
- This source code is only for educational purposes.

## Building

We provide these sources for our customers, and as a reference for Unreal Engine developers. **You won't be able to run the game from this repository alone**, as the game contents are not included. Building from source is only useful if you want to replace the game executable with your modifications.

### Required dependencies

You will need the following tools to build Uwajimaya from the source code:

- **[Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/)** as the game engine. You will need to sign up and download the Epic Games launcher. In the launcher library for Unreal Engine, install version **4.22**.
- [Setup Visual Studio 2017 for Unreal Engine](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/index.html) - You can download Visual Studio 2017 Community edition from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)
  - or after you sign in, directly from [this link](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202017&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads) as Microsoft makes it hard to download VS 2017 (for some reason).
- [Download the **FMOD** plugin (version 1.10.19)](https://www.fmod.com/download) for UE 4.22 and copy the libs Binaries from it, inside `Plugins/FMODStudio/Binaries` directory.
  - You should copy `FMODStudio/Binaries` (after downloading and unzipping) to `Plugins/FMODStudio/Binaries`

### Build

#### 1. Run UnrealBuildTool

The Build command looks like this:

```sh
<engine_install_path>/Engine/Binaries/DotNET/UnrealBuildTool.exe <project_name><target_type> <platform> <build_type> -project=<uproject_absolute_file_path> -progress
```

To build just the Game for Windows 64 run for example:

```sh
"c:/dev/UE/UE_4.22/Engine/Binaries/DotNET/UnrealBuildTool.exe" Uwajimaya Win64 Development -project="C:/dev/Uwajimaya/Uwajimaya.uproject" -progress
```

NOTE: If you want clean the project before you build, just add the `-clean` flag.

For example:

```sh
"c:/dev/UE/UE_4.22/Engine/Binaries/DotNET/UnrealBuildTool.exe" Uwajimaya Win64 Development -project="C:/dev/Uwajimaya/Uwajimaya.uproject" -progress -clean
```

NOTE: You can also build the game by opening the `.sln` file in Visual Studio 2017 and building the `Development Game` target.

#### 2. Copy Binaries

The resulting binaries and debug files will be generated inside `Binaries/Win64/` and can replace the equivalent files in your existing game folder (located at `<install_path>/Uwajimaya/Binaries/Win64/`)

### Run

#### 1. Unarchive pak

The game has the Content inside a `.pak` file which is just an archive. You need to unarchive it with the `UnrealPak` utility.

The pak command utility can be found here:

```sh
<engine_install_path>/Engine/Binaries/Win64/UnrealPak.exe
```

The pak file can be located here:

```sh
<install_path>/Uwajimaya/Content/Paks/Uwajimaya-WindowsNoEditor.pak
```

Extract the pak file:

```sh
<engine_install_path>/Engine/Binaries/Win64/UnrealPak.exe <install_path>/Uwajimaya/Content/Paks/Uwajimaya-WindowsNoEditor.pak -Extract <install_path>
```

NOTE: All paths must be absolute otherwise this won't work.

For Example:

```sh
"c:/dev/UE/UE_4.22/Engine/Binaries/Win64/UnrealPak.exe" "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Uwajimaya/Uwajimaya/Content/Paks/Uwajimaya-WindowsNoEditor.pak" -Extract "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Uwajimaya/"
```

#### 2. Rename paks folder

This is required so that the executable only reads the unarchived files but not the archive itself.

Rename the `<install_path>/Uwajimaya/Content/Paks/` directory to something like `<install_path>/Uwajimaya/Content/_OLD_Paks/`

#### 3. Disable `AuraSDKPlugin`

Open the `<install_path>/Uwajimaya/Uwajimaya.uproject` file and set the `Enabled` field for the `AuraSDKPlugin` plugin to `false`.

The section should look like this:

```json
{
  "Name": "AuraSDKPlugin",
  "Enabled": false
}
```

#### 4. Run the game

Now you can run the game with the modified executable you built above.

`<install_path>/Uwajimaya/Binaries/Win64/Uwajimaya.exe`

Or just the launcher executable in the root directory which calls the above path:
`<install_path>/Uwajimaya.exe`
